# Machine Learning Techniques for Real-Time Cyber Attack Detection in Healthcare using Software Defined Networking

## Abstract
Healthcare systems handle highly sensitive patient data and therefore require
strong and reliable security mechanisms to prevent cyber attacks. This project
proposes a Machine Learning-based Cyber Attack Detector (MCAD) for real-time
intrusion detection in healthcare environments using Software Defined Networking
(SDN). Network traffic is collected through an L3 learning switch and analyzed
using multiple machine learning algorithms. Advanced ensemble techniques such as
Voting and Stacking classifiers significantly improve detection accuracy,
making the system efficient and suitable for real-time healthcare network
protection.

## Problem Statement
Despite the flexibility and centralized control offered by Software Defined
Networking, healthcare networks remain vulnerable to cyber attacks. Malicious
traffic, unauthorized access, and network intrusions can compromise patient
data confidentiality and service availability. There is a critical need for an
intelligent, accurate, and real-time cyber attack detection system for
healthcare SDN environments.
